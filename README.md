# CrossCsharp

a simple GUI on AvaloniaUI on Linux (tested, Fedora)

This project use ReactiveUI

See more on https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia.Samples/tree/main/src/Avalonia.Samples/MVVM/BasicMvvmSample

This is just a playground for me... 

## Can we use Avalonia without MVVM?

You can, directly like WPF, just the autocomplete on VS won't be fast, also on OmniSharp
